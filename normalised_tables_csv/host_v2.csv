CHARACTER REFERENCES  

“I have known Pina for 18 years since I first moved to Seattle when she owned and operated Botticelli Caffe 

As a frequent customer I was able to watch Pina run both the café and another Restaurant over the years Pina was a tireless worker sharing her time between the café her daughter and all of her many friends made through the business 

 The clientele was made up of regulars who came in for her great smile and great conversation Tourists were always given sound advice and direct ions to all of the best Seattle sites

I was able to work again with Pina on the purchase of my home where she was instrumental in finding the house my family enjoyed for several years along with all the close friends and neighbors Pina was able to introduce during our residence Pina is always cheerful dependable and tirelessly working to help those close to her”  
                
SB  Interior Designer

 I was a tenant in an apartment building that Pina managed From inquiring about the apartment to leasing and maintenance Pina proved herself to be friendly responsive and available 

My husband and I felt comfortable and well supported while the building was under Pinas management When a new manager started there was an unfortunate and noticeable change in the sense of community within the building 

After experiencing many other apartment managers I rate Pina as tops She was always professional reasonable and neighborly I would be lucky to find another manager as caring as Pina
BS  Transportation Consultant

“I have known Pina  for 15 years as a wonderful friend reliable apartment manager prosperous business owner a professional Realtor and a wonderfully committed mother

Im in senior product management at Microsoft and if I want to make clear that Pina rates highly in all areas in my opinion  interpersonal communications skills her attention to detail her ability to socialize or work in a group in a charismatic and professional yet relaxed manner She would be an asset to many and scores highly in my opinion”

I run arts  culture nonprofit venues here in Seattle and consult on venue designsremodels in other cities with my Lonely Buildings project  Mature quiet professional very active and not home all that often really  I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options and of course the best local coffee and beer  I almost always know where the good concerts and shows are sometimes free ones too   I play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well Maybe Ill take you out on the water if interested 

Check out my venues by searching Fremont Abbey or Ballard Homestead for concert listings

My housemates and I love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand its a real home not a fancy BB or hotel 
  
Though were not around much sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so thats always fun Generally its a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing 

Our rooms wont always be available as we typically have long term housemates but just depends on the time of year and our vacations

I love to travel and have been so far to Iceland Copenhagen Berlin Haiti New Zealand Australia Honduras Mexico Scotland Ireland England Canada NYC Austin California etc 

I love hot sauces and fun interesting foods talking about social change neuroscience  psychology etc 

Paddleboarding and beach volleyball are pretty much my favorite activities these days but hiking backpacking and sailing are awesome too

We are eager to get to know Europe as the people that live here know it not like the traditional American tourist does through cruise ships and museums  We have learned through our travels that the advice of the local resident is always better than a guide book or brocures at a hotel so we look forward to meeting all the wonderful people on our travels and learning from them  

Alicia minored in Spanish in college lived in Salamanca for a summer and speaks well enough to get by John took some French also and can read for comprehension but does not do well in conversation hopefully our trip will improve both of our language skills  

We enjoy trying all sorts of new food and wine and are very adventurous in that area  We like to go out in the evenings have a few drinks and maybe do some dancing  We are also perfectly happy staying in and having a glass of wine on the patio while the sun sets  

John is a great cook and Alicia is great at cleaning tidying up and great with kids as she is a nanny in the States We have no problem pitching in and helping out with dinner or the chores when the time calls  

I hope this helps shed some light on who we are though we know that we cant tell everything in this little description  We have many hobbies and interests and hope to pick up more on our travels if you are curious or would like to know more about us Please Please ask us we are more than willing to share

Let me just say one thing first I love pork Theres nothing better than roasted pork tenderloin perhaps wrapped in bacon with a honey balsamic vinegar and red wine sauce I could eat pork breakfast lunch and dinner 

Im from California so Im not a typical Northwestern person I like recycling but composting is the absolute worst I like saving the world and being green friendly but Im also cheap and hate buying more expensive green products 

I love to travel and experience new things Im always looking for an inexpensive getaway for a week or weekend We may have that in common Im also an introvert which makes me kind of a contradiction since Im also really loud and possibly obnoxious 

My life motto Dont be an ahole And that is the truth And be extra nice to people in service jobs k thanks

People tell me Im funny Its true I am funny Someone told me Im captivating the other day That just makes me roll my eyes though

I am a fanboy for Jurassic Park Its my favorite movie and I will not tolerate anyone disliking it You can dislike numbers 24 though I wont fault you that Maybe just dont bring it up 

Im also a ridiculous fan of Game of ThronesA Song of Ice and Fire Maybe youll see my tattoo from the novels MAYBE NOT

My favorite all time place to travel is South Lake Tahoe I grew up going there every year and it just doesnt get any better than that There is something particularly magnificent about its smell Pine trees are my favorite You might notice that in my treethemed libraryentryway I love trees

The Sammamish lake view property is located on the East Side an area that is known for being more of a suburban family area and the Seattle property is on the West Side in a suburb next to downtown Seattle which is known for its artsy laid back and eclectic vibe  While that was a lot of what may have been useless information to some it was a long way of telling you that even though we don’t have a lot of reviews on AirBnB we are trustworthy experienced and work to provide customer satisfaction so that you’ll have the best stay possible

Friends who know me know that I love being a steward to houses even working by day for a house moving company where we save fullsized Craftsmanstyle homes by physically moving them from one place to another by land or by barge Nickel Bros house moves have been featured on Home  Garden TVs shows Haulin House and on Discovery and National Geographic Channels Monster Moves

My goal is to make your stay at the Architects Gem one of the best youve ever had

About Owners Brandon  Shanna

A family of Architects plus two kids we are live a bicoastal existence We started our architecture firm about 13 years ago and weve enjoyed fantastic growth designing Green homes and LiveWork urban condominiums and apartment units throughout the Seattle area We are proud to have contributed to the builtspace of Seattle in a positive forwardthinking way and one of the first places we started was renovating our own home — which you can now enjoy

Why West Seattle

We love our West Seattle home and because we are architects weve been able to add to the homes charm over the years as weve lived in it The house itself is a classic 1917 Bungalow but weve added some great usable space and functionality with an open kitchen design and warm and inviting touches architectural details We were drawn to West Seattle because of the wonderful varied and diverse individual urban neighborhoods that West Seattle has to offer Admiral District where we are Alki Beach mustsee Alaska Junction the main urban core Morgan Junction great pub and restaurants FauntleroyEndolyne Ferry to Vashon and Peninsula great restaurants Westwood Village convenient town centre mall We think you will really enjoy this comfortable and inviting house

The Unique Benefits at this House
 
Our home is one that you will immediately feel at home with Weve designed the flow to give you both open and public spaces as well as private nooks and quiet places to rest and relax Fall deeply into the comfortable master bed and open up your book or enjoy entertaining with friends or family during your stay in the large open kitchen and family room Walk a few short blocks to the nearby pubs bars and restaurants enjoy a jaunt down to Alki Beach for a nice Mexican meal at Cactus and take a walk along the boardwalk after your dessert During the day you can rent bikes or rollerblades and ride along the longest boardwalk walking and biking path in Seattle Visit Saltys restaurant on Harbor Avenue overlooking the Seattle skyline or even rent scuba gear and scuba dive with the local in the Elliott Bay Or if you want to tour the Pike Place Market by day or enjoy the Seattle nightlife downtown hop in your car and in 13 minutes during light traffic you will be downtown Take a longer ride out to Snoqualmie Pass for skiing during the winter or hike climb kayak or sail your way through the summer months in the greater Seattle area

How do I travel and see an area  Through food and conversation  I love to experience a new area through the eyes and tastes of those who live in a city I ask the locals where to get coffee and if they had only one last place to eat at in the city where they would go  I adore farmers markets and local shows and website hidden good wine lots of sunlight and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things I love in life  Im looking forward to using Airbnb on many of my future trips  Ive stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels  But sometimes I like to hit that farmers market grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine Ive snagged along the way  Or if Im visiting one of my old homes I want a place where I can ask my family to come over to talk and catch up versus always having to head out on the town

Favorite places so far Ive visited Ireland  great scotch  Italy  Way too many amazing qualities to list Austin  Wonderful live music DC  history politics food hiking and again too many to list

Good quality coffee

Music
Stimulating conversation
My greyhound Rae

My hosting style 
Flexible I want my guests to have the experience they are hoping for If you want a quiet haven youll have it You can be as independent and have as much alone time as you like But if you want to have coffee with me in the morning or watch a movie or walk down to the beach with me and my dog to get some exercise and see the beautiful Puget sound  I like that too

I used to read and try to speak French and German If you speak either of these feel free to try it out on me but go slow and be patient

As a guest
If Im travelling for enjoyment I like getting to meet and interact with my host a little bit I want the chance to meet new people and discover how they live and what their neighborhoods are like

I cant live without staying connected to my friends speaking to people from different countries and backgrounds a daily workout Trader Joes and my family  which includes my hard working husband my son who works in tech in San Francisco and daughter who is in the Coast Guard
We are empty nesters so we decided to make the lower half of our house an AirBnb  It was an obvious choice because we travel a lot and we enjoy meeting people from all over the world  We are new to the AirBnb community  We have a legal unit with all the permits so instead of just renting the space out we decided that it would be more fun and exciting be hosts for the new sharing economy  
As an airbnb host my number one priority is to make you feel completely at home  I will be available as much as you want or I will stay out of your way  The downstairs is completely separate  You will have your privacy  Our house is in the Laurelhurst part of Seattle  It is fitted with everything you could possibly need to have a cozy and warm time including a gas fireplace with a remote full bath with heated floors  The wifi works great
We have so many glorious memories in this house we will do whatever we can to make your stay in Seattle great
My favorite quote is from Helen Keller Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all  being a host for AirBnb has been a daring adventure and it has given energy to our empty nest",within an hour,100%,f,Laurelhurst,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']"

I took my first international trip at 9 years old to Mexico with my mother and two of my older sisters it was magical and lit a spark in me for traveling and experiencing new places and people At 17 I traveled to Brisbane Australia where I lived for two months They drank They were chill At 21 I headed for Capetown South Africa where I blessed to spend 3 months studying traveling and building relationships The people I met  on this trip are still positively influencing me today At 26 I sold my car and bought a ticket to Xela Quetzaltenango Guatemala where I spent one month with some of the most warmlyspirited people you could ever hope to meet I attended PopWuj a local language school and community restoration group and the Trama Textile weaving schoolnonprofit business where I was surrounded by gorgeous textiles full of the colors and stories of the various villages in the area If you ever make it to Xela I would check out the lovework being done in both of these spaces 

Traveling the United States became a passion of mine after I roadtripped to Chicago from Seattle with one of my best friends I was in awe of the land and the skies and felt a renewed sense of this place I realized that even if I wasnt traveling internationally I still had opportunities to travel in my home country and there is just as much to know and see here as anywhere elseAND SO THE ERA OF ROAD TRIPS BEGAN My family road tripped up and down the westcoast my entire childhood but the Midwest and South were uncharted territory for me

There are some other secret spaces and places that are for me and my memories to hold places and destinations so special only a wrongturn and open heart could have made it so

I spend most of my time reading or on my computer in my office I am a selfemployed property manager who livesworks from home so talking to guests who visit is a refreshing break from a mostly solitary life  I have a degree in English literature and traveled widely before settling down and getting married to my house  I am happy to rent extra space in my home out as long as you are a clean quiet selfsufficient and lowmaintenance guest  Please note AirBnB does not do criminal background checks so when I get a request I WILL look your name up on the internet to see if you appear to have a safe profile  Please make sure your booking request includes the information I request for best results I started hosting people in July 2014  As a host I need guests to make sure they understand what they are getting I dont want a guest who doesnt bother to read my listing then gives me less than 5 stars for things they shouldve expected before arriving such as LOCATION  how does a host fix their Location Its on the map or Value did you not search other listings first If you want Value join the homeless and go pitch a tent downtown They have a better location no house rules and dont have to recycle If you dont understand the cost of owning real estate  in Seattle with its property taxes sales taxes cost of utilities and insurance rates then dont review me on your assumptions of what you think the room price should be here without doing some comparison shopping first Were not in Kansas anymore Toto  Bottom line I offer cheap room rentals for shortstay travelers as long as they are wellbehaved guests If you are looking for hotel quality accommodations at this price on Airbnb  youre just NOT going to find it unless you pay hotel quality prices or stay in a place much further out from downtown

Home Cooking this is another thing that I love to do Healthy home cooking is my strong side and I have been doing it for many years as long as there are few ingredients available in the kitchen I can fix a nice dinner

From hospitality perspective I focus on 3 things that I usually look for when I search for hotelapartment 
1 The CLEANEST place that I can feel comfort and cozy 
2 Provide all possible amenities
3 Location Location Location

I pay attention to the details in term of amenitiescleaning and maintenance I am constantly improving the customer experience of my guests by listening to their commentsfeedback I receive and if it is aligned with my philosophy I take the appropriate actions or define an action plan to make the changes over time 

I will be very happy to hear any feedback in order to improve in the coming future so feel free to provide your review

I come from a large family and I have a large family  I love them all  I am a sister to three brothers and two sisters  I have five children along with their five spouses who have blessed me with eight grand children  I guess that means that I identify primarily as a mother and a grandmother

I am also a Licensed Massage Therapist currently with a small practice in  my home  

I love to learn about and put into practice natural and healthy food and dietary choices sustainable living choices natural healing methods etc  

I also love to watch movies but not so much the big box movies as the smaller independent and foreign films  I have quite a collection of them

I attend yoga classes three times a week and find it a very rewarding system of exercise for my body

Im married to a wonderful man Kirk Jolley  We have been together for about 18 years  He is a very talented builder and contractor  He delights in making older homes beautiful again and he is very good at what he does  

We often travel to Hawaii since one son lives there with his family  We also like to go to Mexico and Canada  I like staying in homes apartments or condos because I like having my own kitchen or kitchenette  An unfortunate natural gas exposure has left me with extreme sensitivity to petroleum products and consequently many scented products and foods  This requires me to ask about heating and cooking fuels in homes as well as cleaning products or strongly scented products used therein

My father was a Scout Master and took us camping a lot  He taught us to always leave a place cleaner than we found it  I still do that  My husband often tells me that I am doing the maids job when I clean up a place before I leave it but I cant help itit is ingrained in me  My kids thought I was a bit of a neat freak but Ive noticed that they learned well and they all know how to clean and they keep their homes tidyeven the boys  Needless to say I would take good care of anyones place that I stayed in

42940083,Rick,2015-08-30,"Seattle, Washington, United States","Before I introduce myself I want you to know this is a basement studio in a 110 year old home  I made it as comfortable as possible for you but it is hard to combat age and for lack of a better word  basementness If you are short on a budget or used to the youth hostel lifestyle this may be the place for you 

I am a professor at the UW here in Seattle  In the winter I am a pretty serious about hitting the mountains for skiing and snowboarding  

When I was eleven years old I saw Star Wars Episode 4 and I havent been able to concentrate since then Even though I am solidly into middle age I love living in my super hip Seattle neighborhood and I still go see live music a couple times a month  

In my twenties and thirties I would backpack through Europe once or twice a year  One of the greatest things I ever did was decide to rent an apartment in Prague for a week instead of staying in a hotel or hostel  I decided to create this little private room in my house so that young travelers  maybe you can visit Seattle on a budget 

I have traveled all over the world maybe I have visited your town 

What type of place is this

Are you looking for an expensive warm plush modern room with great light and tall ceilings  If so you should probably move on  This is a tiny private room with a private entrance and private bathroom in my basement  Basements have LOW ceilings about 6 foot 2 inches with a low beam that folks taller than 5 foot 9 will need to duck under  In the winter basements tend to be cold and damp there is no way to avoid this I will provide you with a radiant heater so that you can keep it warm if the ambient heat isnt enough for you   It has a full size fridge a coffee pot a TV wired and wireless internet a small bed a desk a microwave a coffee maker a teapot a pizza oven If you are short  ceiling is only 6 tall if you are a traveler on a budget if you are used to staying in 2 star European hostels and hotels and sharing a bath with 20 other people this place will be perfect for you 

Basically this is a Hobbit hole if you are looking for someplace super nice move on  If you are looking for something affordable in an AMAZING NEIGHBORHOOD this may work for you  

You can walk downtown in 35 mins 10 mins to Broadway and 3 mins to grocery stores bars and amazing restaurants

What type of host am I

You may never even see me  Once we make arrangements I will give you the map the code to the electronic lock and you can come and go as you please
